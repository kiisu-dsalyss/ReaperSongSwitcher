REAPER SONG SWITCHER - COMPLETE SETUP
================================================================================

YOUR SYSTEM IS READY! You have two components:

1. TIMER (Auto-Switcher) - timer.lua
   ✅ Automatically switches songs at the end
   ✅ Runs in background
   ✅ Already set up and running

2. UI (Manual Control) - ui.lua
   ⏸ Manual control window
   ⏸ Needs to be run as a Reaper action

================================================================================
HOW TO RUN THE UI
================================================================================

STEP 1: Open Reaper and press "?" to show Action List

STEP 2: Click "New" button at the bottom

STEP 3: Select "ReaScript (Lua)"

STEP 4: Browse to this file:
   ~/Library/Application Support/REAPER/Scripts/ReaperSongSwitcher/ui.lua

STEP 5: Click OK and name it "Song Switcher UI"

STEP 6: Now you have three ways to use it:

   OPTION A - Run from action list:
      Find "Song Switcher UI" in the list and DOUBLE-CLICK it
      Window appears immediately

   OPTION B - Add to toolbar:
      Right-click "Song Switcher UI" > "Add to toolbar"
      Now click the toolbar button to open it

   OPTION C - Keyboard shortcut:
      Right-click "Song Switcher UI" > "Assign keyboard shortcut"
      Pick a key (e.g., Ctrl+Shift+U)
      Press that key to open UI

================================================================================
WHAT YOU'LL SEE
================================================================================

The UI window shows:
- Currently playing song
- Play/Pause/Stop buttons
- Previous/Next buttons
- Full list of all 5 songs
- Click any song to load and play it

================================================================================
BOTH SCRIPTS WORK TOGETHER
================================================================================

TIMER (Background):
- Runs automatically every 100ms
- Watches for song end
- Auto-loads next song
- You never see it

UI (Visible):

2. Check Reaper console for errors (Windows > Console)
3. Try double-clicking the action again
4. Make sure setlist.json exists in:
   ~/Library/Application Support/REAPER/Scripts/ReaperSongSwitcher/setlist.json
